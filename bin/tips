  "I would rather die of passion than of boredom.  — Vincent Van Gogh",
  "If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual.",
  "I think a lot of new programmers like to use advanced data structures and advanced language features as a way of demonstrating their ability.  I call it the lion-tamer syndrome.

  "The computing scientist’s main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.  — E. W. Dijkstra",
  "Progress in a fixed context is almost always a form of optimization. Creative acts generally don't stay in the context that they are in.  — Alan Kay",

  "Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.",
  "Contrary to popular belief, Unix is user friendly. It just happens to be very selective about who it decides to make friends with.",
  "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.  — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry",
  "There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.  — C.A.R. Hoare",

  "If you don't start with a spec, every piece of code you write is a patch.  — Leslie Lamport",
  "Caches are bugs waiting to happen.  — Rob Pike",
  "Abstraction is not about vagueness, it is about being precise at a new semantic level.  — Dijkstra",
  "dd is horrible on purpose. It's a joke about OS/360 JCL. But today it's an internationally standardized joke. I guess that says it all.  — Rob Pike",
  "All loops are infinite ones for faulty RAM modules.  — graphitemaster",
  "All idioms must be learned. Good idioms only need to be learned once.  — Alan Cooper",
  "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.  — Richard Feynman",
  "If programmers were electricians, parallel programmers would be bomb disposal experts. Both cut wires.  — Bartosz Milewski",
  "Computers are harder to maintain at high altitude. Thinner air means less cushion between disk heads and platters. Also more radiation.",
  "Almost every programming language is overrated by its practitioners.  — Larry Wall",
  "Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small.  — Rob Pike",
  "If C++ and Java are about type hierarchies and the taxonomy of types, Go is about composition.  — Rob Pike",
  "Methods are just functions with a special first argument.  — Andrew Gerrand",

  "Make Quality a Requirements Issue\n\nInvolve your users in determining the project’s real quality requirements.",
  "Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear\n\nDon’t be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.",

  "Write Code That Writes Code\n\nCode generators increase your productivity and help avoid duplication.",
  "Design with Contracts\n\nUse contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less than it claims to do.",
  "Use Assertions to Prevent the Impossible\n\nAssertions validate your assumptions. Use them to protect your code from an uncertain world.",

  "Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms\n\nGet a feel for how long things are likely to take before you write code.",
  "Refactor Early, Refactor Often\n\nJust as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.",
  "Test Your Software, or Your Users Will\n\nTest ruthlessly. Don’t make your users find bugs for you.",
  "Don’t Gather Requirements—Dig for Them\n\nRequirements rarely lie on the surface. They’re buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.",
  "Abstractions Live Longer than Details\n\nInvest in the abstraction, not the implementation. Abstractions can survive the barrage of changes from different implementations and new technologies.",

  "Some Things Are Better Done than Described\n\nDon’t fall into the specification spiral—at some point you need to start coding.",
  "Costly Tools Don’t Produce Better Designs\n\nBeware of vendor hype, industry dogma, and the aura of the price tag. Judge tools on their merits.",

  "Don’t Live with Broken Windows\n\nFix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.",
  "Remember the Big Picture\n\nDon’t get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what’s happening around you.",
  "Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio\n\nMake learning a habit.",
  "It’s Both What You Say and the Way You Say It\n\nThere’s no point in having great ideas if you don’t communicate them effectively.",
  "Make It Easy to Reuse\n\nIf it’s easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.",

  "Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata\n\nProgram for the general case, and put the specifics outside the compiled code base.",
  "Design Using Services\n\nDesign in terms of services—independent, concurrent objects behind well-defined, consistent interfaces.",
  "Separate Views from Models\n\nGain flexibility at low cost by designing your application in terms of models and views.",
  "Don’t Program by Coincidence\n\nRely only on reliable things. Beware of accidental complexity, and don’t confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.",
