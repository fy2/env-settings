Instructions for changing to bash

1) Set bash as default using

/software/bin/lchsh 

Enter password and /bin/bash when prompted

I found I had to do this twice.

To find out what shell you are using, either

ps -p $$
echo $SHELL

2) Only need a file called .profile in your home directory with the following as a minimum

export LSB_DEFAULTPROJECT=teamXX
export LSB_DEFAULTGROUP=teamXX

if [ -z $PS1 ] ; then
     source /etc/bashrc
fi

3) You do not need a .bashrc or a .bash_profile file in your home directory

4) Only need the word pathogen in your .softwarerc

5) I recommend that we all use farm3 for our analysis from now on rather than trying to maintain a set up for both farm2/pcs4 and farm3
